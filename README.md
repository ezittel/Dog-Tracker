# Dog Tracker
This is a php program to track the things I needed to remember to do for my dog<BR>

doggy4 is really the latest incarnation.  <br>


## Dependencies
A mysql database called doggy and two tables, one called dog_saved_activity and the other called dog_activity.
<br>
This works by tracking the current day in dog_activity, and then it copies each day into dog_saved_activity so that you can clear the saved history in a week, month - whatever suits your needs.
